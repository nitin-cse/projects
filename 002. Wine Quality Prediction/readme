Project Overview:
	Project Number - 002
	Project Theme - Machine Learning
	Project Name - Wine Quality Prediction
	Skill Deployed - Machine Learning, Python, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Statistical Data Analysis

Project Objective:
	Given the wine dataset including multi values such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity,..., and quality; we have to develop a machine learning model that can later predict the quality of wine using the input paratmers. This will assist winemakers in developing an understanding of wine quality for a given combination of ingredients.

Personal Reflection:
	While going through this project I developed an understanding of data pre-processing, data cleaning, data standardization, and more, but what made me more fascinated was the Classification Machine Learning Algorithms, such as Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, Support Vector Classifier(SVC). Furthermore, converting skewed data into normalized datasets made an add-on to the knowledge. I would like to further investigate cases where conversion will make more contribution to enhancing the overall performance of the model.
